This document explains how to compile/instrument/run all benchmarks or one selected benchmark.
More detailed information can be found in the Makefiles and shell scripts.

# Compile/instrument/run all benchmarks

You can compile/run all the benchmarks in this directory using one make command.
The targets that can be used in the make command are listed as follows.

- build (the default target): build the original benchmarks.
- small: run the original benchmarks on small inputs.
- large: run the original benchmarks on large inputs.
- clean: clean the original benchmarks.

You can instrument/run all the benchmarks in this directory using one make command.
The targets that can be used in the make command are listed as follows.
Note that the suffix indicates the instrumentation tool being used.
The full path and options of the instrumentation tool should be set in
the file "Makefile.default.TOOLNAME" (at the first line after comments).

- output-movec-memsafe: build the instrumented benchmarks using our tool.
    You can use "O=-O3" to choose a different optimization level.
    You can use "MOVEC_OPTS=--ms-abort" to make the program abort on the first detected error.
    You can use "MOVEC_OPTS=--ms-hashtbl" to make the program use hash tables for storing pmds.
    You can use "MOVEC_OPTS=--ms-no-check" to make the program not perform checks while pass pmds.
    You can use "MOVEC_OPTS=--ms-no-pmd-var" to make the program not use pmd variables.
    Note that the above options can be used together, e.g.,
      make output-movec-memsafe MOVEC_OPTS="--ms-hashtbl --ms-no-check" O=-O3
- small-movec-memsafe: run the instrumented benchmarks on small inputs.
- large-movec-memsafe: run the instrumented benchmarks on large inputs.
- clean-movec-memsafe: clean the instrumented benchmarks.

- output-addresssanitizer
    You can use "ASAN_OPTS=-O3" to choose a different optimization level.
- small-addresssanitizer
- large-addresssanitizer
- clean-addresssanitizer

- output-softboundcets
    You can use "SOCETS_OPTS=-O3" to choose a different optimization level.
- small-softboundcets
- large-softboundcets
- clean-softboundcets

- output-valgrind
    You can use "O=-O3" to choose a different optimization level.
- small-valgrind
- large-valgrind
- clean-valgrind

# Compile/instrument/run one benchmark

You can compile/instrument/run one benchmark using its name (e.g., BENCHMARK) in the make command.
The targets that can be used in the make command are listed as follows.
The make options mentioned above also apply.

- BENCHMARK/small
- BENCHMARK/large
- BENCHMARK/clean

- BENCHMARK/output-movec-memsafe
- BENCHMARK/small-movec-memsafe

- BENCHMARK/clean-movec-memsafe

- BENCHMARK/output-addresssanitizer
- BENCHMARK/small-addresssanitizer
- BENCHMARK/large-addresssanitizer
- BENCHMARK/clean-addresssanitizer

- BENCHMARK/output-softboundcets
- BENCHMARK/small-softboundcets
- BENCHMARK/large-softboundcets
- BENCHMARK/clean-softboundcets

- BENCHMARK/output-valgrind
- BENCHMARK/small-valgrind
- BENCHMARK/large-valgrind
- BENCHMARK/clean-valgrind
