Compile Instructions
--------------------
Type "make".  This will create the executables used by the scripts. If
this doesn't work see the Makefile for details on how
to fix or modify the install process.

Clean Instructions
------------------
Type "make clean".  This will delete post-compile files (i.e.
old executables, output, object files, etc...).
